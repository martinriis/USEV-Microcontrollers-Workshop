## Coding Demo
This is a link to the coding demo I went through during the Wednesday session. 
The demo was performed using an NUCLEO-L432KC connected to a VL53L1X time of flight sensor, however, this should work with any Arduino device, with only minimal modifications required in some cases.

## Getting Started with Arduino for STM32
This document walks you through getting the board support packages installed for using STM32 in the Arduino IDE and getting a blink sketch running.

## Supported Tutorials
This time will give you the oppertunity to try out coding for Arduino either using your own board, or through an online simulator. Myself, Ross McTeir and James Macleod will be available during the Wednesday session to help. 

We've selected a range of tutorials that you might like to try and sorted them into three levels: Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced.
